      <p>
      long times after last time i post my status. 
now  i have three projects :   frd php framework, frd js lib, unicorn .
frd php framework current version is v0.0.9 .
the next version i will :
	1, do small change of Frd_Db, Frd_Db_Table interface
	2, create api interface  Frd_Api  upon Frd_Db_Table
	3, try support php high performance  http sever like : Swoole (http://www.swoole.com/) 
		this is really important, with an high performance http server , i hope i will not need nodejs anymore
		i really hate js's  stupid syntax, use js to create complicate code is waste time 

frd js lib is stoped now . 
	after develop it to v0.0.2,i found for create ui in browser ,there need a  ui render system, 
	a small js lib can not do this. but  does there have a good  ui render system ? seems no
	why this ? i think the js is really too old, for create some simple function, need import much extra js lib .
	and  html+css+js , the desgin seems not good ,  the three all can  modify view , really bad design .
	and because css is  no logic, create big project will cause much problems .
	whatever ,  create web ui is a difficult work,  and the maintain is nightmare .
	so i stop this project. 

	but i found  es6 have some new feature, maybe can fix some problem.
	so i will start it again after i did  research in es6.

unicorn current version is v0.0.6.
	this is the project i focused  these months. really good project. 
	but can say nothing now, it still not ready for publish, maybe need after  2-3 versions, then can publish.


now i combine both english and chinese version together for iamlosing.me .
so you will see both ehglish and chinese character in the website.
not good, but save my times.

i decided use english as iamlosing.me's main language .
CCP become more and more creazy, good english may help me get more chance .
my english is poor, in school , my score is always 60 , (100 is max) 
so i should say sorry , because my article will be much english syntax error, 
readers should guess the meaning ...
of course i will improve my english .

what will i focus on ?
	i guess in the future ,the web develop will be  small server side + heavy client side + powerful maintain tool
	frd php framework is the  small and fast and powerful server side
	frd js lib want to be the heavy client side, but i guess the goal can not reached, i hope there have other guys 
	have the same idea as me , so i can use there code ,then that's possible. 

	the still missed projects is  : 
	  db structure  version control, 
	 deployment center (works like git) , 
         test framework (use python, fast api test and browser client test )


that's all . thanks for reading .  published at 2016-07-03 .
