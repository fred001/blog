      Almost  3 months after last update.
Now I moved to HangZhou and started new job and switched to new domain . 
Recently in HangZhou  is really dirty air ,  heavy  fog  in daytime, like horror movie.
Life is not easy.


I found markdown is really a good syntax, and  there have a website gitbook.com ,
there have a tool called gitbook which can help publish markdown files as  website .
The website can  be viewwed in local or publish to their   website . 
And I have writed a small article about how to install and use it . 

http://doc.frd.life/%E6%9D%82%E9%A1%B9/_book/gitbook_install.html

Here are some steps:
use root account
1.  install npm
2.  npm install gitbook-cli -g   (gitbook-cli is a new version package)

use normal account
3.  gitbook update

Now can use  it .

gitbook  init  (create basic files if not exists)
gitbook  build   (build website which for publish)
gitbook  serve  (listen to 4000 port of localhost, visit 127.0.0.1:4000 to check the result)

their website have more detail about how to use it .


Really a good tool , i will use it to build my  document center .
